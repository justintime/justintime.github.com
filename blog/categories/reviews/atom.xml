    <id>http://sysadminsjourney.com/content/2011/11/14/vps-net-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been running a single node from <a href="http://vps.net">VPS.net</a> for about a
year now.  Please note that my specific experience has been in their "Chicago
Zone D data center", but if you check out their <a href="http://status.vps.net">status
page</a> or search
<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23vpsnet">Twitter</a>, you'll find a lot of others
having the same issues.  While there's a lot of good things to write about,
where they fail is the most important area to me: availabilty. The pros of
using VPS.net include pricing, control panel, and console level access.  As is
typical for a VPS provider, they give you many "add-on" options such as
backup, etc that you can enable -- I've not investigated them myself.  Perhaps
the one of the nicest features is the ability to add server resources or
"nodes" on the fly with minimal downtime. However, it seems that VPS.net has
made a horrible choice in selecting what SAN they use to back their VM's.
Examine the graphic below: <img src="/assets/images/vps-net-availabiltiy.png" alt="" /> As you
can see, I'm getting less than 2 nines worth of uptime from my node.  Each and
everytime there's been an issue, support has been quick to point out that
they've had some sort of SAN issue, and that the SAN is 'resyncing'.  The
problem is that while the SAN is resyncing, I/O to my node is so horrible, I
can't cat a 500 byte file to stdout in less than 10 seconds.  So, the node
will respond to a ping, but it can't serve up a static image via Apache.  For
all intents and purposes, that's down in my book. The <a href="http://status.vps.net/2011/10/chi-d-cloud/">last SAN
synchronization</a> took the better
part of two days, during which time my node was unusable. In my experience,
the SAN is the most important building block when architecting a service
that's meant to be highly available.  Until VPS.net can address their SAN
issues, they are likely to continue to have prolonged downtimes.  Until that's
been fixed, there's just no way I can recommend their services to anyone.</p>

    <link href="http://sysadminsjourney.com/content/2009/08/03/product-review-filerun-php-file-management-system"/>
    <updated>2009-08-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://sysadminsjourney.com/content/2009/08/03/product-review-filerun-php-file-management-system</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/assets/images/fileru%0An.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/large_filerun.jpg" alt="large_filerun.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>At work, we had a need for software that addresses a specific problem. We have
a bunch of users that need to share files in a secure manner via HTTPS, but
the app has to be drop-dead easy. Being an e-commerce shop, we could have
written our own, but we didn't have the time and resources. We could have
outsourced it to <a href="http://www.box.net">box.net</a> or a similar service, but the
company frowns upon outsourced solutions. I happened to stumble upon
<a href="http://www.filerun.com">FileRun</a>, and I have to admit that I've been very
impressed. Read on for the full review.</p>

<p>First things first, let's get the negatives out of the way. There's just a
few, and they didn't impact us:</p>

<ul>
<li>FileRun encrypts it's PHP code using <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/products/guard/">Zend Guard</a>, making the majority of their code not viewable by the end user. In order to run Zend Guard encrypted binaries, you have to install a PHP module to run them.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://docs.filerun.com/index.php?title=Main_Page">online documentation</a> covers only the basics. Many of the features are undocumented, but are fairly self explanatory.</li>
<li><p>The software is written by developers in Romania. Again, this was not a problem for us, but emailing support sometimes got replies at odd hours of the day.
Now, onto the positives. First of all, FileRun is very well written software.
I've found only one bug, and it was a minor bug introduced in only the most
recent update. I emailed support about it, they offered to patch it for me
immediately if I couldn't wait for it to be fixed in the next release. The
development team operates under the "release early, release often" mantra,
with new updates coming out about once a month. The support is very good; I
got fast, knowledgeable answers to all my questions. The pricing is very
workable and advertised on their site, and there is <a href="http://www.filerun.com/demo">an online demo offered at
their site</a>. Where the software shines is in it's
interface. The main file interface is a typical Windows-like explorer window
with two panes - one for folder navigation, the other for contents of the
selected folder. Using AJAX, they have made the application feel more like a
desktop application than a webapp. There are three methods of uploading files,
one is a standard HTML form-based upload, the second is a Flash-based upload,
and the third is a Java applet. The java applet allows for drag-and-drop
uploads, and it also gets around the PHP upload limitations allowing you to
upload unlimited file sizes (I uploaded a 2.6GB Solaris DVD iso to it and it
didn't skip a beat!). Any user who is used to file management on a desktop
system will be off and running in no time. The backend has the concepts of
Users, Groups, and Roles. Roles should probably have been called a "User
Template", because that's really what they are. Each user can have one Role
assigned to it, and the Role overrides settings such as home directory,
permissions, etc. Groups are simply containers that hold one or more users,
and each user can belong to zero or greater groups. Groups are used for
sharing folders and setting permissions on shares. If I'm in Accounting, I can
create a new directory under my home directory, and share it to the Payroll
department. When a member of the payroll department logs in, they will see my
shared folder. I can dictate whether payroll can upload, download,
rename/delete/change files and folders in that shared directory as well. While
Groups are used to set permissions on files shared between authenticated
users, one of the biggest requirements for us was to be able to offer
downloads to unauthenticated users. This is where the weblinks feature comes
in, and I believe it's the biggest feature in the application. Once I upload a
file to FileRun, I can generate a weblink. This is simply a link generated by
the PHP script that looks something like
http://my.domain.com/weblinks/?id=b6d767d2fde85d21a44b0e4567680cb9. The user
generating the weblink can set a shared password on the link, set an
expiration date for the link, or even set the max number of allowed downloads
for the link. The UI also has built in support for emailing a weblink directly
from the app instead of copy/paste into your MUA. FileRun supports thumbnail
generation via the <strong>convert</strong> binary from ImageMagick, so anytime a user
uploads a pdf, jpg, png, psd, etc, a thumbnail is generated. There is also a
search index feature where MS Office documents and PDF's are indexed and are
searchable via the UI. FileRun also supports versioning, but I haven't yet
researched whether or not the versioning stores only the deltas, or complete
copies of the files - I suspect the latter. Another important feature of
FileRun is that it stores the file itself on the filesystem - metadata is
stored in MySQL. This means that you can interact with the files from the OS
as well as from within FileRun. Another nice feature is the fact that it
supports zip/unzip operations from within the UI, no need for external
programs to create/extract zip files. Features that are there, but I haven't
played with yet include:</p></li>
<li><p>Online editing via Zoho.com and Snipshot.com</p></li>
<li>WebDav - MS Web Folders isn't supported (what's the point?)</li>
<li>Email files as attachments.</li>
<li>All actions are logged to the DB, and you can generate email-based notifications using rules. You can get emailed about every little activity, or only failures.</li>
<li>External Authentication is supported.</li>
<li>A recycle bin prevents unintended deletions.</li>
<li>See FileRun's <a href="http://www.filerun.com/features">full feature list</a> for more details.
We've been using the software here for a couple of weeks, and I love it. It
solves a problem for us that would have cost a lot more in dev time than what
the licensing cost is, and they support the software, not us. It's not without
it's issues, the pros far outweigh the cons.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://sysadminsjourney.com/content/2008/09/10/virtualbox-20-quick-impressions"/>
    <updated>2008-09-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://sysadminsjourney.com/content/2008/09/10/virtualbox-2-0-quick-impressions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm not new to the virtualization scene, but I'm no expert either -- I've been
using <a href="http://www.vmware.com">VMWare</a> Workstation since 1.0,
<a href="http://www.vmware.com">VMWare</a> Server since 1.0, and
<a href="http://www.xensource.org">Xen</a> since around 2.0. Well, I needed a Windows XP
install on my laptop, and decided it would be a good time to see how
<a href="http://www.virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a> compared. <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org">VirtualBox
2.0</a> was just released
(<a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Changelog">changelog</a>), so I went with the
bleeding edge. Read on for my quick review of
<a href="http://www.virtualbox.org">Virtualbox</a> 2.0.  My laptop was running Ubuntu
Hardy, but your experience is likely to be the same no matter the distro you
prefer.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>Not much to say here. I clicked a link on <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">the download
page</a>, GDebi popped up, and I
installed the deb. Can't get much easier!</p>

<h3>Guest OS Installation</h3>

<p>Anyone familiar with VMWare workstation should feel right at home here. Fire
up the gui, click 'New', create a new Windows XP guest machine. I accepted the
defaults of 192MB RAM and 10GB disk. Now, it's been a really long time since
I've installed Windows XP, but I swear that the installation went faster from
within VirtualBox than natively. No metrics to back that up, just a gut
feeling.</p>

<h3>Networking</h3>

<p>Worked out of the box. I accepted the default configuration of NAT through the
host. Immediately I ran Windows Update after installation, and went to bed.
The next day, everything had worked as it should have.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>

<p>The changelog states that numerous performance improvements have been made
since 1.0, but since I don't have past experience, I can't speak to how much
better it performs. I can tell you that running Windows XP as a guest under
Virtualbox 2.0 did not feel any faster, nor any slower that running Windows XP
as a guest under VMWare Workstation on the same laptop. While installing SP3
for Windows XP in the guest, I noticed fairly significant host responsiveness
degradation. However, my laptop still has a PATA drive in it, and my XP VM was
using the "hard disk as a file" method instead of a dedicated partition. My
hunch is that support for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCQ">NCQ</a> and
dedicated partitions helps this quite a bit. Also, when using the XP VM under
normal conditions that didn't write to the disk so extensively, the host
machine was still very responsive.</p>

<h3>Hardware Support</h3>

<p>Below is the list of what I've tested under my XP VM:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>USB:</strong> I'll get to this eventually, but I don't need it yet.</li>
<li><strong>Sound:</strong> Worked flawlessly.</li>
<li><strong>CD/DVD Drive:</strong> No problems here either.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>VirtualBox is an impressive product. Consider me a convert from VMWare
Workstation, VirtualBox does everything I need it to and more, and the cost of
zero is something VMWare Workstation can't begin to compete with!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Follow the jump to read more about <a href="https://midas.psi.ch/elog/">ELOG</a>, the
best little logbook available!  When I read <a href="http://lifehacker.com/399919%0A/simplify-troubleshooting-with-a-change-log">the LifeHacker article about how
to simplify troubleshooting with a ChangeLog</a>, I immediately thought about one
of my favorite webapps - <a href="https://midas.psi.ch/elog/">ELOG</a>. Written by Stefan
Ritt, ELOG aims to be simple, self-contained, performant, and extendable. It
achieves all of these goals and surpasses them. ELOG is written in C, and is
it's own webserver. No need to run Apache, it's got it's own. It's single
threaded, but for what it is, one thread is enough. We use it to keep track of
our servers at work, we have a ServerLog logbook. We also use it as a Change
Request management tool. It has done both for us without a hiccup, let alone a
crash in the two years we've used it. A feature request I made to Stefan was
implemented that same week! Anyways, if you're looking for an application to
log entries of data over time, look no further than

    <link href="http://sysadminsjourney.com/content/2008/08/01/linode-review"/>
    <updated>2008-08-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://sysadminsjourney.com/content/2008/08/01/linode-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently switched from
<a href="http://www.aplus.net" title="Aplus.net">Aplus.net</a> shared Unix hosting
to
<a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=c4f79463ba583ec1f15e3307190bda4bda9d65df" title="Linode">Linode</a>
Xen-based VPS hosting. Follow the jump to read my reviews of both.
I had a shared Unix account with Aplus.net for about a year. Aplus
used FreeBSD with jails to provide their shared hosting. While that
gave me the ability to ssh into the box, I could not get root. It
did however, work quite well - the control panel is nice, and you
could use about anything you wanted to. I never needed to use their
support, their control panel worked great, and I never had any
issues with billing. There were two drawbacks, one minor, the other
major:
1.  The box was firewalled to death. I'm all for firewalls, but I</p>

<pre><code>like to be in control of it. Not only were inbound ports blocked
(which is a good thing), but all outbound access was blocked as
well. This made hard things impossible, and easy things hard. For
example, adding a simple RSS widget to your page hosted on Aplus
just will not work.
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>The particular box I was on was severely over-sold. I have no
idea how many shared accounts there were on the box, but there were
times where my simple little wordpress blog was completely
unavailable. $12 a month is cheap, but I at least expect to be able
to render pages!</li>
</ol>


<p>After doing a bunch of research, my choice for a new hosting
provider was down to
<a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=c4f79463ba583ec1f15e3307190bda4bda9d65df" title="Linode">Linode</a>
and <a href="http://www.slicehost.com" title="SliceHost">SliceHost</a>. In the end,
I settled on
<a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=c4f79463ba583ec1f15e3307190bda4bda9d65df" title="Linode">Linode</a>
because I was reading some grumblings that SliceHost was having
some growing pains, and I couldn't find any negatives to
<a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=c4f79463ba583ec1f15e3307190bda4bda9d65df" title="Linode">Linode</a>.
So, at 10:57pm on July 30th, I started the sign up process for a
<a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=c4f79463ba583ec1f15e3307190bda4bda9d65df" title="Linode">Linode</a>
540 in their Dallas datacenter. At 11:07pm that night (10 minutes
later!) I had full access to my server. Very impressive! By 11pm on
July 31st, I had moved my blog from Aplus to
<a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=c4f79463ba583ec1f15e3307190bda4bda9d65df" title="Linode">Linode</a>
without any hitches. First, let me tell you what
<a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=c4f79463ba583ec1f15e3307190bda4bda9d65df" title="Linode">Linode</a>
is and isn't.
-   <strong>Linode is</strong>a provider of Xen-based virtualized hosts. This</p>

<pre><code>means you get to pick which distribution you want, and you get your
own root account with which you can do what you feel like.
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><strong>Linode provides</strong>a DNS Manager included with all their plans
that allows you have full control over any number of domains. I had
no idea this existed until I signed up, and it was a great little
side benefit. I was able to cancel my DNS service at a registrar
that I was paying $15 a year for.</li>
<li><strong>Linode provides</strong>you with a Xen instance with 4 cores of Xeon
for CPU, and a configurable amount of RAM, bandwidth, and storage.</li>
<li><strong>Linode provides</strong>a out-of-band management tool named lish
(LInode SHell) which gives you console level access to your
server.  There is also an AJAX web-based console interface
available.</li>
<li><strong>Linode provides</strong>you with everything you need to build your
own server. You may do with this server what you like, provided
it's for law-abiding activities. You have the ability to create
your own partitions, upgrade your kernel, install packages,
whatever!</li>
<li><strong>Linode provides</strong>you with more than enough rope with which
you can hang yourself! This is a logical extension of the above
point. If you have root, you can most certainly do a 'rm -rf /' and
no one will stop to ask you if you're sure or not.</li>
<li><strong>Linode is not</strong>your run-of-the-mill webhoster. If you want to
run your own LAMP stack, you are more than welcome to do so.
However, <strong>you</strong>are responsible for the setup and maintanence of
the entire stack. There's no cute little control panel button you
click to setup a blog. If you don't know Linux, and don't want to
learn how to do these sort of things, you're better off with a
provider such as Aplus.net.</li>
</ul>


<p>After signing up, you get to pick which data center you want your
server to be hosted in.  Here are their current datacenters:
-   Newark, NJ
-   Atlanta, GA
-   Dallas, TX
-   Fremont, CA</p>

<p>You can view what servers are available in what datacenters

<a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=c4f79463ba583ec1f15e3307190bda4bda9d65df" title="Linode">Linode</a>,
I must say that I'm thoroughly impressed. Uptime is 100%, and I
haven't needed support for anything at all. My blog runs as it
should - and if it didn't it would be my fault for not setting it
up properly. I will update this post in the future with more data
as I learn more about the service. Also, if you'd like to give
