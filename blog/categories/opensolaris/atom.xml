    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Why is it that we always find the good documentation after we've fumbled our
way around the help and man pages? Such is the case with <a href="http://www.opensolaris.com/use/network_administration.pdf">"OpenSolaris Network
Administration for Administrators Familiar with
Linux"</a>. If you're
someone that is familiar with Linux (the doc annoyingly equates RHEL to
Linux), and are thinking about installing OpenSolaris, make sure you download
this PDF and keep a hardcopy handy!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In OpenSolaris, the xterm bindings aren't there for the End and Home keys -
they do nothing. Yes, I know, Ctrl+a and Ctrl+e do the same things, but my
laziness has turned into muscle memory. Here's how to fix it:  As your normal
user, run the following:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir /tmp/foo
env TERMINFO=/usr/share/lib/terminfo /bin/infocmp xterm &gt; /tmp/foo/xterm.ti
echo ' knp=\E[6~, kpp=\E[5~, kend=\EOF, khome=\EOH, '  &gt;&gt; /tmp/foo/xterm.ti
env TERMINFO=/tmp/foo /bin/tic -v /tmp/foo/xterm.ti
cd /usr/share/lib/terminfo/x/
pfexec cp xterm xterm.orig
pfexec cp /tmp/foo/x/xterm xterm.new
pfexec cp xterm.new xterm
</code></pre>

<p>Now your home and end keys will behave like your used to in Linux! All of this
was pretty much copied and pasted from <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/solarisx86/message/2%0A0027">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/sol
arisx86/message/20027</a> - thanks to Juergen Keil for the tip!</p>

    <link href="http://sysadminsjourney.com/content/2009/06/19/fixing-cpan-perl-module-installation-issues-opensolaris"/>

    <id>http://sysadminsjourney.com/content/2009/06/19/fixing-cpan-perl-module-installation-issues-on-opensolaris</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In OpenSolaris, if you're installing perl modules via CPAN, you might run into
this error:</p>

<pre><code>cc: unrecognized option `-KPIC'
cc: language ildoff not recognized
cc: ReadKey.c: linker input file unused because linking not done
</code></pre>

<p>In order to fix that, edit the file /usr/perl5/5.8.4/lib/i86pc-solaris-
64int/Config.pm, and make the following changes to the existing lines for
'optimize' and 'cccldflags': <strong>UPDATE! Thanks to reader Vesta for his tip. The
original tip I posted will not fix all the issues, for example Apache2::Util
won't install.</strong> This problem occurs because the Sun developers build perl
with the cc from SunStudio, but by default, the first 'cc' found in a user's
path is a symlink to gcc. All you need to do is to install SunStudio, and
prefer it's cc:</p>

<pre><code>pfexec pkg install ss-dev
</code></pre>

<p>Now, edit ~/.profile, and prepend your path with SunStudio's bin directory,
like so:</p>

<pre><code>export PATH=/opt/SunStudioExpress/bin/:/usr/gnu/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
</code></pre>

<p>You can log out, reboot, source the new .profile, or export a new PATH
variable to make the new settings stick. Now you should be able to install
most any Perl module!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, like I did with Linux ten years ago, I installed OpenSolaris 2009.06 on
my primary workstation at work. There's simply no better way to learn an OS
than to force yourself to run it. While I was pretty close to Ctrl-C'ing the
whole project a couple of times, I'm now getting things set up pretty much the
way I need them to be. Stay tuned for articles with my tips, but here's my
first impressions:</p>

<ul>
<li>IPS - the new package manager is fairly robust. It certainly appears to have some speed issues, but all in all, it works pretty well. It has a good selection of software available - not extensive, but enough to get you going. I'm sure both the speed and the quantity will both improve with time.</li>
<li>The Gnome Desktop as shipped has a very sharp and clean feel to it. It's hard to describe, but I like it.</li>
<li>From what I can tell, Compiz is only supported with NVidia graphics cards. The fglrx driver doesn't yet exist for OpenSolaris.</li>
<li>It really sucks trying to debug Xorg setup without virtual consoles!</li>
<li>While I'm a long ways from being comfortable, I'm now at a point that I don't think I'll find any showstopping issues.</li>
</ul>

    <id>http://sysadminsjourney.com/content/2009/06/16/installing-the-pidgin-encryption-plugin-on-opensolaris</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You can install Pidgin from the OpenSolaris.org repository, but there's no
package for the Pidgin-Encryption plugin. Once you point it in the right
direction, it's not hard to install the plugin from source.</p>

<pre><code>pfexec pkg install SUNWgcc SUNWxorg-headers SUNWgnome-common-devel
tar -xzvf pidgin-encryption-3.0.tar.gz
cd pidgin-encryption-3.0
./configure --with-nspr-includes=/usr/include/firefox/nspr/ \
  --with-nspr-libs=/usr/lib/firefox/ \
  --with-nss-includes=/usr/include/firefox/nss/ \
  --with-nss-libs=/usr/lib/firefox/ --prefix=/usr
make
pfexec make install
</code></pre>

<p>Restart Pidgin, and go to Tools->Plugins, and enable the Pidgin Encryption
plugin.</p>
