    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/assets/images/nginx.gif" alt="" />Just a quick posting of some simple benchmarks
today. Please note, these are not the be all, end all performance results that
allow everyone to scream from atop yonder hill that Solaris performs better
than Linux! This was just me doing a little due dilligence. I like Solaris 10,
and wanted to run it on our webservers. We&rsquo;re looking at using NGINX to serve
up some static files, and I wanted to make sure it performed like it should on
Solaris 10 before deploying it - you know, right tool for the job and all. So,
disclaimers aside, here&rsquo;s what I found.</p>

<h2>The Hardware</h2>

<p>The hardware I tested was a Dell PowerEdge R610, with 12GB RAM, and 2x4 Core
Nehalem CPU&rsquo;s. SATA disks were used with the internal RAID controller, but no
RAID was configured.</p>

<h2>The Benchmarks</h2>

<p>I used ApacheBench, as shipped with Glassfish Webstack 1.5. Yes, I know,
there&rsquo;s all kinds of flaws with ApacheBench, but the key here isn&rsquo;t the
benchmarking tool, it&rsquo;s that the tool and it&rsquo;s configuration remain the same.
Here&rsquo;s the command line I used:</p>

<p><code>/opt/sun/webstack/apache2/2.2/bin/ab -n1000000 -k -c 2000
http://localhost/static/images/logo.jpg</code></p>

<h2>CentOS 5.4</h2>

<p>I installed CentOS 5.4, ran yum to get all the updates possible. I then
installed NGINX 0.7.64 from source, and simply copied one image file into the
document root. I did a few sysctl tweaks for buffers and whatnot, but found
later that they didn&rsquo;t impact the benchmark. Here&rsquo;s what ApacheBench running
on the local host had to say:</p>

<p>No matter how you slice it, that&rsquo;s pretty darn fast. I knew that Solaris 10
had a completely rewritten TCP/IP stack optimized for multithreading, and that
it should keep right up with Linux. However, NGINX uses different event models
for Linux and Solaris 10 (epoll vs eventport), so I wanted to make sure there
weren&rsquo;t any major differences in performance.</p>

<h2>Solaris 10</h2>

<p>I installed Solaris 10 x86, ran pca to get all the updates possible. I then
installed NGINX 0.7.64 from source, and simply copied one image file into the
document root. Here&rsquo;s what ApacheBench running on the local host had to say:</p>

<p>Again, very impressive results. Overall, it appeared as though Solaris+NGINX
was just a few millis faster than CentOS+NGINX in most cases, but certainly
not enough to change your mind of what platform to use. If you notice the 4.5
second request on the Solaris box, I&rsquo;m pretty sure that&rsquo;s a TCP retransmit
that I can work out with ndd tuning.</p>

<h2>The Verdict</h2>

<p>NGINX is freaking fast. My hunch is that it&rsquo;s so fast, that I&rsquo;m actually
running up against the limits of ApacheBench, not NGINX &ndash; but that&rsquo;s just a
gut feeling. The verdict is that you won&rsquo;t be making a mistake going with
either Linux or Solaris when setting up your NGINX server.</p>

    <link href="http://sysadminsjourney.com/content/2009/10/14/new-solaris-10-update-8-zfs-support-flash-archives"/>
    <updated>2009-10-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://sysadminsjourney.com/content/2009/10/14/new-in-solaris-10-update-8-zfs-support-in-flash-archives</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/assets/images/solaris.gif" alt="" />The<a href="http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/pr/2009-10/sunflash.20091008.3.xml"> release of Solaris 10 10/09 (Update
8)</a> has come
and gone, and without too much fanfare from my point of view. In my opinion,
there is one new feature that will really help propel root ZFS installations
into the enterprises where there was resistance before. You see, many larger
corporations have invested a lot of time and money into using Flash Archive
coupled with Jumpstart to be able to deploy golden images to many machines in
a small amount of time. However, up until now, ZFS and Flash Archive were
incompatible, meaning you were forced to use UFS root file systems if you
wanted to use Flash Archive installs. Some have <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/scottdickson/entry/a_much_better_way_to">even went to great lengths to
hack solutions
together</a>, but I
doubt they made many in-roads into the enterprise. Read on for a quick
overview of Flash Archive and ZFS support in the latest update of Solaris 10.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/819-5461/githk?l=en&amp;a=view">Sun&rsquo;s ZFS Administration
Guide</a>, here&rsquo;s
some potential &ldquo;gotcha&rsquo;s&rdquo;:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Only a JumpStart installation of a ZFS Flash archive is supported. You cannot use the interactive installation option of a Flash archive to install a system with a ZFS root file system. Nor can you use a Flash archive to install a ZFS BE with Solaris Live Upgrade.</p></li>
<li><p>You can only install a system of the same architecture with a ZFS Flash archive. For example, an archive that is created on a sun4u system cannot be installed on a sun4v system.</p></li>
<li><p>Only a full initial installation of a ZFS Flash archive is supported. You cannot install differential Flash archive of a ZFS root file system nor can you install a hybrid UFS/ZFS archive.</p></li>
<li><p>Existing UFS Flash archives can still only be used to install a UFS root file system. The ZFS Flash archive can only be used to install a ZFS root file system.</p></li>
<li><p>Although the entire root pool, minus any explicitly excluded datasets, is archived and installed, only the ZFS BE that is booted when the archive is created is usable after the Flash archive is installed. However, pools that are archived with the flar or flarcreate command&rsquo;s <strong>-R</strong> rootdir option can be used to archive a root pool other than the one that is currently booted.</p></li>
<li><p>A ZFS root pool name that is created with a Flash archive must match the master root pool name. The root pool name that is used to create the Flash archive is the name that is assigned to the new pool created. Changing the pool name is not supported.</p></li>
<li><p>The flarcreate and flar command options to include and exclude individual files are not supported in a ZFS Flash archive. You can only exclude entire datasets from a ZFS Flash archive.</p></li>
<li><p>The flar info command is not supported for a ZFS Flash archive.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>There&rsquo;s a few constraints in there that might cause a few people problems, but
overall Sun has done a good job opening up yet another in-road to the
enterprise folks to let them experience the joy that is administering ZFS.</p>

<p>I have yet to setup Flash Archive and ZFS myself, but once I do, you can bet
I&rsquo;ll post about it!</p>

    <link href="http://sysadminsjourney.com/content/2009/09/23/not-so-typical-jumpstart-part-three-scripts"/>
    <updated>2009-09-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://sysadminsjourney.com/content/2009/09/23/not-so-typical-jumpstart-part-three-the-scripts</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img align="left" alt="" height="101" hspace="15" src="http://sysadminsjourney.com/assets/images/solaris.gif" width="190"/>
In <a href="http://www.sysadminsjourney.com/content/2009/09/21/not-so-typical-jumpstart-part-two">part two of the series</a>, we left off with a non-working Custom Jumpstart setup.  By creating our Jumpstart profile file and a sysidcfg file, we&rsquo;ll have a basic, but working Custom Jumpstart.  The profile contains settings specific to the installation, where the sysidcfg file contains settings specific to the machine during and after installation.</p>

<h2>Step One: Create the sysidcfg file</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve been following along, we specified the path to web1&rsquo;s sysidcfg file when we generated our dhcpd.conf file in <a href="http://www.sysadminsjourney.com/content/2009/09/18/not-so-typical-jumpstart-part-one">part one</a>. Let&rsquo;s create this file, so that the installer doesn&rsquo;t have to ask us these questions during the installation:</p>

<pre>
cd /export/home/jumpstart/configs
mkdir -p sysids/web
cat &lt;&lt;EOD &gt; sysids/web/sysidcfg
keyboard=US-English
system_locale=en_US.UTF-8
security_policy=NONE
nfs4_domain=domain.com
name_service=DNS {domain_name=domain.com name_server=192.168.0.5}
network_interface=bge0 { protocol_ipv6=no
  primary
  hostname=bkeweb1
  ip_address=192.168.0.21
  default_route=192.168.0.10
  netmask=255.255.255.0
}
terminal=vt100
timezone=US/Central
timeserver=localhost
root_password=8X123/ZkOFICY
service_profile=limited_net
EOD
</pre>


<p>You should read the manpage for sysidcfg, but in our example above some of the not-so-obvious settings are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>security_policy=NONE</strong> is relative to the kerberos security settings during installation.</li>
<li><strong>root_password</strong> the value of root&rsquo;s password as written in a real /etc/shadow file.</li>
<li><strong>service_profile=limited_net</strong> - using limited_net disables unnecessary services and restricts others to localhost access only. I recommend this setting for anyone not in a lab environment.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Step Two: Create the profile file</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s a huge amount of operations you can configure via the jumpstart profile - I recommend reading <a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/820-7014/preparecustom-53442?l=en">Sun&rsquo;s documentation on creating a Jumpstart profile</a>. I also owe a link to the <a href="http://kdl.nobugware.com/post/2009/07/28/ultimate-solaris-10-jumpstart-profile/">Keep Da Link</a> blog for a nice list of clusters and packages to install. Using this profile below will result in an installation with pretty much every command line tool you would need, minus any X11/Gnome packages. Here&rsquo;s the contents of my Jumpstart profile:</p>

<pre>
cat &lt;&lt;EOD &gt; webserver

package         SUNWpostgr-82-libs
EOD
</pre>


<p>After running an install with this profile, you will end up with a ZFS root that contains just under 2GB worth of data. If that&rsquo;s not your desired setup, then tweak away!</p>

<h2>Step Three: Validate the profile file</h2>

<p>The last step in this article is to validate the rules file and its associated profiles. Run the following:</p>

<pre>
# ./check
Validating rules...
Validating profile webserver...
The custom JumpStart configuration is ok.
</pre>


<p>This process validates your config files, and creates a rules.ok file in the root of your config server directory. It is this file that the client loads and parses when starting a Jumpstart installation.</p>

<p>This concludes part three of the series. You should now be able to boot using PXE for X86 or using &lsquo;boot net:dhcp - install&rsquo; from Sparc, and have a completely automated installation. However, you likely also have a rather vanilla installation which we&rsquo;ll remedy in part four of the series.</p>

not-so-obvious settings are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>security_policy=NONE</strong> is relative to the kerberos security settings during installation.</li>
<li><strong>root_password</strong> the value of root&rsquo;s password as written in a real /etc/shadow file.</li>
<li><strong>service_profile=limited_net</strong> - using limited_net disables unnecessary services and restricts others to localhost access only. I recommend this setting for anyone not in a lab environment.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Step Two: Create the profile file</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s a huge amount of operations you can configure via the jumpstart
profile - I recommend reading <a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/820-7014/preparecustom-53442?l=en&amp;a=view">Sun&rsquo;s documentation on creating a Jumpstart profile</a>. I also owe a link to the <a href="http://kdl.nobugware.com/post/2009/07/28/ultimate-solaris-10-jumpstart-profile/">Keep DaLink</a> blog for a nice list of clusters and packages to install. Using this
profile below will result in an installation with pretty much every command
line tool you would need, minus any X11/Gnome packages. Here&rsquo;s the contents of
my Jumpstart profile:</p>

<p><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="go">cat &amp;lt;&lt;EOD &gt; webserver</span>
<span class="go">install_type    initial_install</span>

<span class="go">&lt;h1&gt;pool           name  size swap dump devices&lt;/h1&gt;</span>

<span class="go">bootenv         installbe bename s10_u7</span>
<span class="go">partitioning    default&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="go">&lt;h1&gt;base cluster&lt;/h1&gt;</span>

<span class="go">&lt;p&gt;cluster SUNWCreq&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="go">&lt;h1&gt;additional clusters and packages&lt;/h1&gt;</span>

<span class="go">&lt;h1&gt;optional clusters and packages&lt;/h1&gt;</span>

<span class="go">&lt;h1&gt;cluster SUNWCapache add # Apache 1.3.9&lt;/h1&gt;</span>

<span class="go">&lt;h1&gt;cluster SUNWCapch2 add # Apache 2&lt;/h1&gt;</span>

<span class="go">package         SUNWjpg</span>
<span class="go">package         SUNWpng</span>
<span class="go">package         SUNWxwplt</span>
<span class="go">package         SUNWpostgr-82-libs</span>
<span class="go">EOD</span></code></pre></div></p>

<p>After running an install with this profile, you will end up with a ZFS root
that contains just under 2GB worth of data. If that&rsquo;s not your desired setup,
then tweak away!</p>

<h2>Step Three: Validate the profile file</h2>

<p>The last step in this article is to validate the rules file and its associated
profiles. Run the following:</p>

<p><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="go">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="go">&lt;h1&gt;./check&lt;/h1&gt;</span>

<span class="go">&lt;p&gt;Validating rules&amp;hellip;</span>
<span class="go">Validating profile webserver&amp;hellip;</span>
<span class="go">The custom JumpStart configuration is ok.</span></code></pre></div></p>

<p>This process validates your config files, and creates a rules.ok file in the
root of your config server directory. It is this file that the client loads
and parses when starting a Jumpstart installation.</p>

<p>This concludes part three of the series. You should now be able to boot using
PXE for X86 or using &lsquo;boot net:dhcp - install&rsquo; from Sparc, and have a
completely automated installation. However, you likely also have a rather
vanilla installation which we&rsquo;ll remedy in part four of the series.</p>
