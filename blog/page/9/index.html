  <div class="entry-content"><p>Running GUI&#8217;s over an SSH tunnel is nothing new, and not too tricky. However,
I recently had a case where I wanted to run a java-based GUI (dhcpmgr) as root
on a remote host, and have it display on my local Linux box. I hit a couple of
snags, so I thought I&#8217;d post them here to hopefully help out others.  First,
we need to configure the Solaris 10 SSH server to allow remote SSH forwarding.
First, make sure you have the following in your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file:</p>

<pre><code>X11Forwarding yes
X11DisplayOffset 10
X11UseLocalhost yes
</code></pre>

<p>If you had to make changes to the file, restart SSH by doing a</p>

<pre><code>svcadm refresh ssh
</code></pre>

<p>Now, onto the Linux client. If X11 forwarding in general is working, but you
get a blank window when running Java apps, here&#8217;s what you need to do. Edit
/etc/ssh/ssh_config and make sure the following is in there:</p>

<pre><code>ForwardX11Trusted yes
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, we have both ends setup, now it&#8217;s time to make the connection. From
the Linux client:</p>

<pre><code>ssh -CX mynonrootuser@solarisbox
</code></pre>

<p>The -C option compresses the connection, the -X option sets up X11 forwarding.
Now, we need to run our app as root. Don&#8217;t do like your fingers want you to do
here! My fingers are so trained to typing &#8216;su -&#8217; to become root, but the
trailing dash blows away some important environment variables. Instead, do a</p>

<pre><code>su
</code></pre>

<p><strong>without the trailing dash!</strong> Now, fire up your Java GUI, and bookmark this page. You&#8217;re a Unix SysAdmin, and you need GUI&#8217;s so little that you&#8217;ll surely forget how to do all this when you need it next ;-)</p>

<time datetime="2009-04-23T00:00:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Apr 23<span>rd</span>, 2009</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s a step-by-step howto on how to configure the ALOM card on a Sun Fire
server so that it&#8217;s accessible over the network via SSH. It should also work
for Sun Fire V210, V215, V240, V245, V445, V250, V440, and V445 servers as
well.  You must first program the card via the operating system. You can do
this via the serial cable or SSH session.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First, cd into the proper directory:</p>

<p>cd /usr/platform/<code>uname -i</code>/sbin</p></li>
<li><p>Now, show the current version of firmware on the card:</p>

<p>./scadm version</p></li>
</ul>


<p>If it&#8217;s not version 1.6, <a href="https://cds.sun.com%0A/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/CDS-CDS_SMI-Site/en_US/-/USD/ViewProductDetail-%0AStart?ProductRef=ALOM-1.6-G-F@CDS-CDS_SMI">download the latest from Sun</a></p>

<pre><code>* Current latest version of firmware is 1.6.9, you will download the file ALOM_1.6.9_fw_hw0.tar.gz
* Run the following commands to update firmware:


mkdir /usr/platform/`uname -i`/lib/images
cd /usr/platform/`uname -i`/lib/images
gzip -dc ~/ALOM_1.6.9_fw_hw0.tar.gz | tar xvf - 
/usr/platform/`uname -i`/sbin/scadm download boot alombootfw; echo "done, now sleeping for 60 seconds"; sleep 60
/usr/platform/`uname -i`/sbin/scadm download alommainfw
</code></pre>

<p>After a couple minutes, the card should be ready for use.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Now display the current configuration like so:</p>

<p>./scadm show</p></li>
</ul>


<p>You should get output like this:</p>

<pre><code>if_network="true"
if_modem="false"
if_emailalerts="false"
sys_autorestart="xir"
sys_bootrestart="none"
sys_bootfailrecovery="none"
sys_maxbootfail="3"
sys_xirtimeout="900"
sys_boottimeout="120"
sys_wdttimeout="60"
netsc_tpelinktest="true"
netsc_dhcp="false"
netsc_ipaddr="0.0.0.0"
netsc_ipnetmask="255.255.255.0"
netsc_ipgateway="0.0.0.0"
mgt_mailhost=""
mgt_mailalert=""
sc_customerinfo=""
sc_escapechars="#."
sc_powerondelay="false"
sc_powerstatememory="false"
sc_clipasswdecho="true"
sc_cliprompt="sc"
sc_clitimeout="0"
sc_clieventlevel="2"
sc_backupuserdata="true"
sys_eventlevel="2"
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>Let&#8217;s setup the card so that it can be reached via SSH. Run the following commands, replacing the IP settings with your own:</p>

<p>./scadm set if_network true
./scadm set netsc_tpelinktest true
./scadm set netsc_ipaddr 192.168.1.18
./scadm set netsc_ipnetmask 255.255.255.0
./scadm set netsc_ipgateway 192.168.1.1
./scadm set sc_cliprompt srv1-mgmt
./scadm set mgt_mailalert &#8220;me@my.com 3&#8221;
./scadm set mgt_mailhost 192.168.1.5
./scadm userpassword admin
./scadm set if_connection ssh
./scadm set if_emailalerts true</p></li>
<li><p>Verify your configuration by doing a</p>

<p>./scadm show</p></li>
</ul>


<p>When done, you need to reset the SC, like this:</p>

<pre><code>./scadm resetrsc
</code></pre>

<p>You&#8217;re done!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently had to setup the RSC card on some v490&#8217;s to enable remote console access.  Unfortunately, these cards only do telnet, and not SSH, but when you need console access, you have to have it!

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>It used to be that in order to add persistent static routes in Solaris, you
had to whip up your own init script that manually ran &#8216;route add&#8217;. Starting
back in Solaris 10 11/06, Sun finally gave us a better way to do it.  From the
<strong>route(1M)</strong> man page:</p>

<pre><code>     -p

         Make changes to  the  network  route  tables  persistent
         across  system restarts. The operation is applied to the
         network routing tables first and, if successful, is then
         applied  to  the  list  of  saved  routes used at system
         startup. In determining whether an  operation  was  suc-
         cessful, a failure to add a route that already exists or
         to delete a route that is not in the  routing  table  is
         ignored. Particular care should be taken when using host
         or network names in persistent routes, as  network-based
         name  resolution  services are not available at the time
         routes are added at startup.
</code></pre>

<p>So, all you need to do to add a static route for 192.168.0.0/24 to be accessed
via gateway 192.168.1.1 on each boot is this: <div>
  <pre><code class='bash'>/usr/sbin/route -p add 192.168.0.0 192.168.1.1</code></pre>
</div>
 Currently,
these routes are stored in /etc/inet/static_routes, but Sun doesn&#8217;t guarantee
it will stay there. I&#8217;m not sure I like being forced to use a command when I
could just edit a config file, but it&#8217;s a definite improvement!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m not for sure when they did it, but the RHEL folks made it a bunch easier
to setup simple source policy routing. By using source policy routing, we fix
the issue of firewalls freaking out when the reply packet to a host leaves a
multihomed host on a different interface than what the request came in on. In
prior versions, you had to setup some custom scripts, but that&#8217;s no longer the
case - all the hooks are there in the OS now.  In this example, imagine a
CentOS host with two nics. 192.168.0.2/24 is on eth0, and 10.0.0.2/24 is on
eth1. The default gateway is set to 192.168.0.1. Any host accessing 10.0.0.2
from any subnet that isn&#8217;t on 10.0.0.0/24 will have it&#8217;s reply packets sent
out via 192.168.0.1. Some firewalls drop this type of traffic <em>cough</em> Cisco
ASA&#8217;s <em>cough</em>. Thanks to the iproute2 package in Linux, this is easy enough to
fix. RedHat has made it even easier now - we can do this in 3 steps (all
performed as root):</p>

<h3>Step 1: Create a table</h3>

<p>We need to create a table for iproute2. Name it anything you want, and add it
to /etc/iproute2/rt_tables, like so: <div>
  <pre><code class='bash'>echo -e
&quot;200\tCorpNet&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/iproute2/rt_tables</code></pre>
</div></p>

<h3>Step 2: Create a route</h3>

<p>We need to create a route for eth1 that says to use our CorpNet table defined
in Step 1. <div>
  <pre><code class='bash'>echo &quot;default table CorpNet via 10.0.0.1&quot; &gt;
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-eth1</code></pre>
</div></p>

<h3>Step 3: Create a rule</h3>

<p>We need to create a rule for eth1 that says to use our route above for traffic
received on eth1. <div>
  <pre><code class='bash'>echo &quot;from 10.0.0.2 table CorpNet&quot; &gt;
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/rule-eth1</code></pre>
</div></p>

<h3>Step 4: Restart networking</h3>

<div>
  <pre><code class='bash'>/etc/init.d/network restart</code></pre>
</div>


<p> That&#8217;s it.
Fire up a packet sniffer and verify your config!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, according to NYT, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/03/technology/business-%0Acomputing/03blue.html?_r=1">the IBM buying Sun deal is near
final</a>. No sir, I don&#8217;t like it one bit.  I view the
merger like this: IBM is a bunch of bureaucrats that know how to sell, and Sun
is a bunch of brilliant geeks that would much rather focus on cool tech than
making money. While IBM had the whole &#8220;pushing Linux&#8221; thing going on, all I
can think of is some commercials on TV, and Eclipse. Sun has open sourced
Java, Glassfish, VirtualBox, OpenOffice, and MySQL. They basically started the
multi-core movement with Niagra, and OS&#8217;s that won&#8217;t implement ZFS are
struggling to copy it. If IBM buys Sun, and keeps everything as it is now &#8211;
great! Sun would actually make money, and we&#8217;d still have all that cool stuff.
Unfortunately, there&#8217;s a lot of clashing products, and engineers don&#8217;t
generally perform well in a company like IBM. Personally, I think it stinks,
and pray that something happens to stop the inevitable.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The last couple of months for me have been spent cramming 1200 pages of meaty
Solaris information into my brain. At the end of my sacrifice, I have an
<a href="http://www.sun.com/training/certification/solaris/scsa.xml">SCSA</a>
certification to show for it. Was it worth it? For me, yes. For my employer,
yes. For everyone, no.  I&#8217;ve never been much for certifications. Heck, I
really didn&#8217;t even have much desire to get my 4 year bachelor&#8217;s degree - I
just knew that I would be better off if I had it. Fresh after graduation, I
got my <a href="http://certification.comptia.org/a/default.aspx">A+ Certification</a>. It
made me feel good, but never really did anything for me. During my job as a
computer repair tech, I had the misfortune of dealing with way too many paper
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/LEARNING/MCP/MCSE/">MCSE</a>&#8217;s that couldn&#8217;t write a
batch file. The whole experience really soured me to certifications in general
&#8211; to the point of me discrediting many people that had
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcp/">MCP</a> or MCSE in their email
signatures. In my next job, as the sysadmin of a dialup/cable modem ISP, I had
a somewhat improved experience in being exposed to
<a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/ccie/index.html">CCIE</a>&#8217;s - most of them
could at least do IP subnetting without a cheatsheet. I actually learned
enough RedHat Linux that I could have probably taken a month of studying and
turned it into an <a href="https://www.redhat.com/certification/rhce/">RHCE</a>
certification, but decided against it. So, what made me turn to the dark side
and get my SCSA? The idea hit me when Sun offered a promotion for half-off
their training and testing package. I ran it by my boss, and he was cool with
the company paying for it, and me using a little company time to do my
studies. I figured what the heck, and went for it. Here&#8217;s what I learned:</p>

<ul>
<li>In my case, my certification was motivation. While I had worked with Solaris for the past 3 years, I really hadn&#8217;t learned that much about it. Up until a few months ago, I hated SMF (what was so bad about init scripts?), and had no idea how to use ZFS. I didn&#8217;t know where Solaris excelled, and instead used Linux for everything that I could. Now I know much more about the differences between Solaris and Linux. Details on that in a future post, but I can now make a well informed decision on what OS fits the job best, and I feel comfortable administering either.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s up to you to get what you need out of the certification. If you want a piece of paper, you can go download &#8220;dumps&#8221; that contain every possible question you&#8217;ll see on the cert exam, and memorize them all. You&#8217;ll flounder and die out in the field, but that&#8217;s your prerogative. I read the materials, took notes, and at the end of each chapter I performed the actual tasks on a Solaris box at home. That type of learning sticks with you, and will likely save your arse someday.</li>
<li>The test itself gets absurdly detailed at times. They expect you to memorize command line options, and give you know man pages to lookup. Sometimes the only difference between two answers is the -S in answer A versus the -s in answer B.</li>
<li>The test makes you memorize things you don&#8217;t have to memorize in the field. The key to effective systems administration is good problem solving skills coupled with a good knowledge of the tools available to you. Thanks to man pages and Google, you don&#8217;t need to memorize command line options, just know the command(s) that will get you out of trouble.
When all is said and done, it wasn&#8217;t the most pleasant experience ever, but it
was one I&#8217;d do again. I now have confidence when faced with a Solaris problem.
I must say that while I&#8217;ll stick with Linux on my desktop and laptop, I&#8217;ll
actually lean towards Solaris on the server side of things. I learned a lot of
things that I never would have learned had I not had to take the test, and my
employer will benefit as well. By the way, if you&#8217;re looking for good material
on the SCSA, go for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Solaris-System-%0AAdministration-Exam-%0APrep/dp/0789738171/ref=pd_bbs_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1238810994&amp;sr=8-2">Bill Calkin&#8217;s book</a> and
avoid <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Certified-Administrator-Solaris-%0A310-200-310-202/dp/0072229594/ref=sr_1_17?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1238811080&amp;sr=1-%0A17">Paul Sanghera&#8217;s</a> book. I read both, and feel that Bill&#8217;s book much better prepared me for
the exams. The cert doesn&#8217;t make the sysadmin, but the sysadmin can make the
cert work!</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sorry for the hibernation period. I&#8217;ve just completed my
<a href="http://www.sun.com/training/certification/solaris/scsa.xml">SCSA</a> exams. It
wasn&#8217;t easy, but I passed! I have a data center move happening at work as
well, but with my SCSA stuff (3 hours of studying each night for the past 3
weeks!) out of the way, I should have at least some time to post some content
in the near future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found this over at the <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=261366">Ubuntu Forums</a>, but since it took me
forever to find, I&#8217;m dropping notes here. In RPM-based distros, you can do
&#8216;rpm -qa > somefile.txt&#8217;. In Debian/Ubuntu, do this:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='bash'>dpkg --get-selections &gt; machineA.txt</code></pre>
</div>


<p>In true apt fashion, if you
then want to have machine B have all the software machine A has, do this:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='bash'>dpkg --set-selections &lt; machineA.txt &amp;&amp; dselect</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Enjoy!</p>
