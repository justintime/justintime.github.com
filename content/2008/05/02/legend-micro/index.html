<div class="entry-content"><p>This issue did finally get resolved and Paypal didn&rsquo;t need to step
in. I&rsquo;m going to remove any editorial remarks, and just leave the
factual emails here. If you do have any problems, I would recommend
getting Simon involved, he was prompt and professional - Justin I
bought what was listed as a &ldquo;Hauppage PVR-150 MCE PCI Card&rdquo;, and
received something compeletely different. Below is a copy and paste
of all my communications with them. On 4/23, I sent my first email
to them: Dear legendmicro-wholesale, I just received my tuner card,
and it&rsquo;s not as the auction implied. It is not compatible with with
the WinTV-PVR-150 MCE PCI #1042, it&rsquo;s a completely different card
with different inputs, outputs and chipsets. I run MythTV on Linux,
and there are no drivers for this card. I would gladly exchange
this card for a &ldquo;true&rdquo; WinTV PVR 150. If you don&rsquo;t have one, I will
need to get a refund. -techadvise Later, on 4/23, they responded
via eBay: We do not advertize this card as being Linux compatible.
If you would like to return this card: PLEASE CONTACT OUR CUSTOMER
SERVICE please use link below to file an RMA
<a href="http://www.legendmicro.com/return-auth.asp">http://www.legendmicro.com/return-auth.asp</a> -legendmicro-wholesale
Okay, fair enough. I didn&rsquo;t really go into all the details about
how their auction was completely incorrect. So, I did that next. On
4/24, I sent them this via eBay: Dear legendmicro-wholesale, I can
contact your customer service, but I don&rsquo;t think you understand
just how incorrect your listing is. Here are the major points: -
The title reads &ldquo;Hauppauge WinTV-PVR-150 MCE PCI Tuner Card&rdquo;. This
card doesn&rsquo;t have anything at all in common with a Hauppage card.
It is a Emuzed Maui I/II, and is described in detail here:
<a href="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/ivtv/devel/14252.">http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/ivtv/devel/14252.</a> The auction
states the card has an FM Tuner, it does not. The auction says it
has a composite video input, and the card does not. These are just
the major points. I need to either have a card that fits the
auction description sent to me free of charge, or I can return this
card for a refund. I don&rsquo;t think I should be responsible for paying
freight in either direction as I would not have bid on the auction
if the listing was correct. Please confirm that I will receive
either a replacement or a full refund. Justin -techadvise To which
they replied on 4/24: Dear techadvise, Justin, You will need to
contact customer service to proceed with the RMA. PLEASE CONTACT
OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE please use link below to file an RMA
<a href="http://www.legendmicro.com/return-auth.asp">http://www.legendmicro.com/return-auth.asp</a> -legendmicro-wholesale
So, on 4/28, I send them this via eBay: Dear legendmicro-wholesale,
I contacted customer service on April 24th at 4:30, and still
haven&rsquo;t heard back yet. If we don&rsquo;t have a plan in place by
tomorrow at noon, I&rsquo;m just going to start working with Paypal/Ebay
to get my money refunded. Justin -techadvise To which Legend Micro
replied on 4/28: Dear techadvise, PLEASE CONTACT OUR CUSTOMER
SERVICE please use link below to file an RMA
<a href="http://www.legendmicro.com/return-auth.asp">http://www.legendmicro.com/return-auth.asp</a> -legendmicro-wholesale
Gosh, that looks a lot like their last message. So, I got a little
frustrated, and sent them this back via eBay on 4/28: Dear
legendmicro-wholesale, IF YOU READ MY PREVIOUS MESSAGE YOU WOULD
KNOW THAT I HAVE! Thanks for making my decision easy. Enjoy your
negative feedback. -techadvise To which they replied on 4/28: Dear
techadvise, RMAs are processed in the order that they are received.
Sometimes it can take up to 2 business days to process an RMA. If
you would like to talk to someone regarding your RMA, please call
customer service 800-935-9305 x3 -legendmicro-wholesale At this
point, I opened a case with Paypal. Here&rsquo;s what I posted to Paypal
on 4/28 to initiate a dispute: I bid on and won eBay item
#260231153044 a “Hauppauge WinTV-PVR-150 MCE PCI Tuner Card”. What
I received was a TV tuner card, but nothing close to the
specifications set forth in the auction. The auction title reads
“Hauppauge WinTV-PVR-150 MCE PCI Tuner Card”. This card doesn’t
have anything at all in common with a Hauppage card. It is a Emuzed
Maui I/II which is a cheap knock-off of the Hauppage. The auction
states the card has an FM Tuner, it does not. The auction says it
has a composite video input, and the card does not. I have sent
email to the seller 4 times. Each time, he replies with the same
copy &amp; paste answer: &mdash; PLEASE CONTACT OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE please
use link below to file an RMA
<a href="http://www.legendmicro.com/return-auth.asp">http://www.legendmicro.com/return-auth.asp</a> &mdash; When I go to the
above site, the RMA procedure states that I will be liable for S&amp;H,
which I don’t believe I should be. I emailed the customer service
address listed on his site on 4/24, and have yet to hear back. As I
have explained to the seller, I am willing to accept either a full
refund of $49 or a true Hauppage PVR-150 MCE PCI card. I will
gladly ship the seller’s card back to him at his expense.
Metaphorically speaking, I bid on an American sports car, and
recieved a British 4 door sedan with the steering wheel on the
opposite side. Sure, it’s a car, but it’s unusable to me, and
doesn’t even come close to matching the original description. On
4/29, the seller updated the Paypal case: dear customer, we
apologize for inconvinience,we never received the RMA request from
you, please close the dispute, you will be issued RMA # and
pre-paid shipping label and you will be refunded in full as soon as
we will get the product back in stock, for any questions, please
call our customer service 800-935-9305 ext 3-Kat, thank you
Immediately after receiving that message, I filled out the RMA form
on their site, and put Kat&rsquo;s email above in the notes field. I
immediately got an autoreply stating that my request had been
received. On 4/30, I get this via my personal email account,
bypassing eBay and Paypal: Dear customer, we apologize for
inconvenience, we never received the RMA request from you, please
close the dispute, you will be issued RMA # and pre-paid shipping
label and you will be refunded in full as soon as we will get the
product back in stock, for any questions, please call our customer
service 800-935-9305 ext 3-Kat, thank you Thank You for Your
Business Kat (Customer service) @LegendMicro.com 30700 Carter

800-935-9305 Ext. 3 440-498-0706 Fax LegendMicro.com On 4/30, I
replied back to Kat directly: Kat, My apologies, but since the
dispute seems to be my only way to get a quick response from your
company, I&rsquo;m going to keep it open until the issue is resolved. I
never submitted an RMA request before, I simply emailed
<a href="&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#116;&#111;&#x3a;&#115;&#101;&#114;&#118;&#105;&#x63;&#101;&#x40;&#x6c;&#x65;&#103;&#x65;&#110;&#x64;&#109;&#105;&#x63;&#x72;&#x6f;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d;">&#x73;&#x65;&#114;&#118;&#x69;&#99;&#101;&#64;&#108;&#x65;&#103;&#x65;&#x6e;&#x64;&#x6d;&#105;&#99;&#114;&#111;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;</a> with questions that I never received a
response to. However, I did submit an RMA form last night, and got
an autoreply, but nothing else after that. My request number is
501014. Thanks, Justin On 5/1, I received this update to the Paypal
dispute case: please close dispute and call 800-935-9305 ext 3 On
5/1, I update the Paypal case with the recent communications, and
set forth an ultimatum: As I stated in my email to you yesterday, I
will not close this dispute until my dispute is resolved. It is
not. I have filled out your RMA form, and received a request number
of 501014. I have not received an RMA number, nor a pre-paid
shipping label. Since your priority seems to be getting me to close
this dispute without actually resolving the problem, I&rsquo;m going to
mandate that all future communications take place through Paypal
for third-party documentation - I will not call you. Once I recieve
an RMA number and a prepaid shipping label, I will ship the part
back to you. Once my paypal account is refunded, I will close this
dispute. UNTIL THAT POINT IN TIME, I WILL NOT CLOSE THIS DISPUTE!
Please stop asking me to do so. We have 17 days to get this
resolved before I file a claim. I suggest you stop trying to get me
to close the dispute and get around to sending me that RMA number
and shipping label that you&rsquo;ve been promising me for 3 days now.
Justin After updating the case, Kat emailed me at my personal email
account on 5/1: As soon as we will see the dispute closed, you will
be emailed RMA # along with prepaid shipping label and we do have
the right item in stock for you. Thank You for Your Business Kat

440-498-0706 Fax LegendMicro.com I updated the case with paypal
with this: Paypal, Kat from LegendMicro just emailed my personal
email account, disregarding my request to stop communicating &ldquo;out
of band&rdquo;. Directly quoting her entire email: &mdash;BEGIN QUOTE&mdash; As
soon as we will see the dispute closed, you will be emailed RMA #
along with prepaid shipping label and we do have the right item in
stock for you. Thank You for Your Business Kat (Customer service)

440-776-8839 Direct Voice 800-935-9305 Ext. 3 440-498-0706 Fax
LegendMicro.com &mdash;END QUOTE&mdash; It is obvious to me that the seller
is not concerned with customer service, only with closing this
dispute. Probably so that they can string me along further without
a deadline hanging over them. It&rsquo;s my opinion that I&rsquo;ve done
everything I can to facilitate fair commerce between myself and the
seller, and that the seller has done nothing to try and resolve the
issue. To date, I have still never received an RMA number, nor a
shipping label. I give up. They have done nothing that I ask, and
really seem to want me to take this &ldquo;offline&rdquo;. My only recourse at
this point is to turn this over to Paypal as a claim. Paypal, I
have complete documentation of all email communications between the
seller and myself should you need it. Thanks, Justin I then
escalated the dispute to a claim with this comment: While the
seller will answer my emails, they will not give me an RMA number
or a shipping label. They continue to try and get me to close the
dispute without giving me any indications that they will follow
through with their statements. Shortly after posting this blog
entry, and giving negative feedback on the seller, I finally got an
RMA from them. There&rsquo;s some semi-sensitive information in the
email, so I&rsquo;ll refrain from posting it here. However, two things to
note: - The RMA reflects that the card is indeed an Emuzed card,
not a Hauppage. Did they know all along? - The RMA includes a
refund on my original shipping charge. This is good! However, I
didn&rsquo;t get any notice of a shipping label to send the Emuzed card
back to them. So, I sent them an email asking about the freight to
them on 5/2: Thank you for the RMA number. Kat in customer service
promised me that I would receive a pre-paid shipping label to
return the part back to you. What is the status on that label?
Justin Also on 5/2, I received a reply from someone (judging from
the typing style, either Kat or the seller) to my personal email
account: Please Close the dispute and you will receive the shipping
label. I immediately replied: The dispute is closed it&rsquo;s a claim
now. You can send me the shipping label, and I&rsquo;ll stop the claim.
Or you can lose the claim, pay me my refund and have to deal with
Paypal marking you as a questionable merchant. Your choice. It&rsquo;s
beyond the point of the money now, it&rsquo;s the principle of the whole
thing. You guys didn&rsquo;t do jack for me until I opened the claim.
Hell, I have a good reason to think that you knew you were selling
me something different than what I bid on. There&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m going
to give up the only leverage I have in exchange for your &ldquo;word&rdquo;
that you&rsquo;ll get me a shipping label. You might like to know that
I&rsquo;m tracking all of our communications via my blog so that Paypal
and other potential customers of yours can get a heads up on what
kind of shady practices you take part in.
<a href="http://techadvise.com/2008/05/02/legend-micro/">http://techadvise.com/2008/05/02/legend-micro/</a> - I update it quite
regularly. Justin I received an email from Simon on 5/2: Justin,
First of all, I’d like to apologize on behalf of Legend Micro for
the miscommunication that occurred with this transaction. Second,
I’d like to give you this shipping label in hopes of resolving the
claim/dispute. Along with that, I’d like for you to consider
removing the negative feedback you left for us. I’d also like to
explain to you what happened in the misunderstanding: Our warehouse
mistakenly sent the wrong card. This is our mistake and you should
have been issued a shipping label from the beginning. We do have
the Hauppauge card that you originally ordered in stock. We would
be more than happy to send you the card that you originally bought
in exchange the card that was incorrectly shipped to you. Please
let me know if you would like the Hauppauge card or a full refund.
You can contact me directly at this email or by calling me at
either of the numbers below. Regards, Simon Legend Micro 30700
Carter Street Suite B Solon, Ohio 44139 Phone: 888-368-7573
Direct/International: 440-394-4570 To which I replied: Simon, THANK
YOU!!! This is all that I have wanted done since this issue was
started 11 days ago. I would love to get the proper card sent out.
Let&rsquo;s do this - I will drop the original card off at the UPS store
with the label you have sent me. If you ship out the replacement
and supply me with the tracking number, I will close the Paypal
claim, and update my feedback on eBay. Let me know if this works
for you. Again, thank you for finally stepping up. Justin A few
minutes later Simon replied back: Justin, Sure this is not a
problem. We can ship out the card as soon as we see that the label
we sent you has been activated and the package is in UPS'
possession. Please let me know when you are planning on dropping
the card off at the UPS store. Regards, Simon I sent him the
following email: I will do this over my lunch break in the next
couple of hours. Simon and I emailed back and forth a few more
times, and they did what they promised. Once their tracking number
showed the package was in UPS' hands, I got a shipment notification
of the replacement card. On 5/7, I received my replacement which is
quite obviously a &ldquo;true&rdquo; Hauppage WinTV PCI card.</p>
