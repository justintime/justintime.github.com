It snuck up on me so fast, I forgot to ask - are any of my SysAdmin's Journey
readers going to San Franciso for DrupalCon? If so, [contact
me](http://sysadminsjourney.com/contact), and we'll see if we can meet up for
a beer! I'm posting this from DIA, so if you happen to be here and want to
grab a bite to eat, ping me. I'm flying out to SF at about 12:30pm MDT.
