So, [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com) has [released HipHop
PHP](http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?blog=1&story=358) - a PHP-to-C++
converter. While the name is stupid, the idea is not. 100% of their developers
know PHP, I would guess that less than 5% of them are proficient at C++. So,
HipHop takes their PHP code, and converts it to compiled C++ -- in turn, they
get a huge boost in performance and get to keep their existing developers.
HipHop is also it's own webserver too - fun! My first thought was: I wonder
what this could mean for Drupal? Well, [David
Struass](http://fourkitchens.com/authors/david-timothy-strauss), a maintainer
of [Pressflow (a set of patches for Drupal performance and
scalability)](http://fourkitchens.com/pressflow-makes-drupal-scale) put up a
[blog post](http://fourkitchens.com/blog/2010/02/03/making-drupal-pressflow-
more-mundane) about what it would take for Pressflow and Drupal to become
HipHop-friendly. Exciting times!
