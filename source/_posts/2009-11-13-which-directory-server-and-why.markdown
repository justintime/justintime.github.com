One of my projects for 2010 is to get a reliable directory server in place. I
was going to post a poll to my readers asking what they felt was the best DS,
but [Ben Rockrood](http://www.cuddletech.com/blog/index.php) beat me to it
with his article [Community Poll: Whats your favorite Directory
Server?](http://www.cuddletech.com/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=1094). It's likely
that most of the readers of this blog already read Ben's too, but if you don't
it's a great blog to subscribe to. If you have any input into the debate on
what DS is the best, [head on over and leave a
comment](http://www.cuddletech.com/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=1094)!
