If you would have told me 5 years ago that:

  2. I would take personal time off from work to attend DrupalCon (and not regret it)
  3. I would attend a Microsoft party

to the party as a saboteur on a mission: to drink as much as I could to try
and directly impact their bottom line. Mission accomplished :) Good times @
DCSF2010!
