This week, I'm off to my [RH300 course](https://www.redhat.com/courses/rh300_r
hce_rapid_track_course_and_rhce_exam/) which involves taking my
[RHCE](http://www.redhat.com/certification/rhce/) exam on Friday. It's funny
-- studying one thing from 9-5 without any distractions or multitasking truly
feels like a vacation to me. After 5pm, I go back to my room and play. I'm
pumped! Wish me luck!
