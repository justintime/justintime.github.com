So, according to NYT, [the IBM buying Sun deal is near
final](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/03/technology/business-
computing/03blue.html?_r=1). No sir, I don't like it one bit.  I view the
merger like this: IBM is a bunch of bureaucrats that know how to sell, and Sun
is a bunch of brilliant geeks that would much rather focus on cool tech than
making money. While IBM had the whole "pushing Linux" thing going on, all I
can think of is some commercials on TV, and Eclipse. Sun has open sourced
Java, Glassfish, VirtualBox, OpenOffice, and MySQL. They basically started the
multi-core movement with Niagra, and OS's that won't implement ZFS are
struggling to copy it. If IBM buys Sun, and keeps everything as it is now --
great! Sun would actually make money, and we'd still have all that cool stuff.
Unfortunately, there's a lot of clashing products, and engineers don't
generally perform well in a company like IBM. Personally, I think it stinks,
and pray that something happens to stop the inevitable.
