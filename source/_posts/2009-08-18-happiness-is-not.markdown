![No happiness here!](/assets/images/medium_sad_face.jpg)I bit the bullet and
jumped on a sweet deal on a latest-gen 17" MacBook Pro late last week. It was
a refurb, and I was too cheap to pay for quick shipping, so Apple told me it
wouldn't ship for 5-7 business days. Whatdya know, they were on-the ball and
shipped it out early. It arrived at my desk on Monday. Normally this would be
good except that I'm almost 400 miles away from my desk, and won't be back
until Friday! Arrrggghhh! Oh well, I probably wouldn't get any studying done
if I had it with me!
