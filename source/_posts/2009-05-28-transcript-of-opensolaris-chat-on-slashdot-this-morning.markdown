Dangit, I knew I forgot something today!!! Today was the day that some very
"in-the-know" Sun engineers participated in an open chat about
[OpenSolaris](http://www.opensolaris.org) on [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org).
For those of you like me who were too busy fighting fires to participate,
[here is a link to the transcript](http://dlc.sun.com/osol/advocacy
/opensolaris-slashdot-session-28-05-2009.html). I wish I could make it to
[CommuntyOne West](http://developers.sun.com/events/communityone/2009/west/ind
ex.jsp?intcmp=2706) this year, but I found out about it too late. Anyone
going?
