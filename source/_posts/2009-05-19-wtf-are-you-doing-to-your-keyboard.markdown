So, I have yet to upgrade my laptop to Ubuntu Jaunty, but I saw [this article
on how to re-enable Ctrl+Alt+Backspace in
Jaunty](http://lifehacker.com/5259425/re+enable-ctrl%252Balt%252Bbackspace-
for-ubuntu-904) come through my feed reader. A little more research dug up
this [Ubuntu Wiki entry](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/DontZap)
proclaiming: a number of users have complained about accidentally restarting
their X-Server Now, maybe I'm getting old, but I can't tell you how many times
I've been saved a reboot by that handy Ctrl+Alt+Backspace shortcut. My rant?
What in the hell are you trying to do that you "accidentally kill X" by
happening upon hitting that key combination? Was it really **so** many people
that you had to kill the shortcut for **everyone**? There is a line that can
be crossed when listening to your users, and I think Ubuntu has just crossed
it. What are your thoughts?
