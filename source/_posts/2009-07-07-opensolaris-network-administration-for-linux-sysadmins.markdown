Why is it that we always find the good documentation after we've fumbled our
way around the help and man pages? Such is the case with ["OpenSolaris Network
Administration for Administrators Familiar with
Linux"](http://www.opensolaris.com/use/network_administration.pdf). If you're
someone that is familiar with Linux (the doc annoyingly equates RHEL to
Linux), and are thinking about installing OpenSolaris, make sure you download
this PDF and keep a hardcopy handy!
