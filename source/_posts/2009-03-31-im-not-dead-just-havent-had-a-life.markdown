Sorry for the hibernation period. I've just completed my
[SCSA](http://www.sun.com/training/certification/solaris/scsa.xml) exams. It
wasn't easy, but I passed! I have a data center move happening at work as
well, but with my SCSA stuff (3 hours of studying each night for the past 3
weeks!) out of the way, I should have at least some time to post some content
in the near future.
