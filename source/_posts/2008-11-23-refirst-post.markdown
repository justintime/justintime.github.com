Last night, I completed the transition from Wordpress to Drupal. Why? Well
just try and look at the code. Drupal is the cleanest PHP implementation I've
ever seen, and Wordpress is like most of the other PHP apps I've seen.  Yet
another reason I love my
[linode](http://www.linode.com/?r=c4f79463ba583ec1f15e3307190bda4bda9d65df) -
I was able to build my new VM at home, then upload it to my host. Total
downtime was about 5 minutes, and I am now running on a completely new
partition built from scratch. Anyways, I'm sure there will be plenty of kinks
to work out, but it looks like most of the stuff is working. Drop me a comment
if you find something out of whack. Stay tuned for a post on how to "take your
linode image home with you".
