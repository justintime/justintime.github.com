We are the 2nd owners of this vehicle, we bought it in spring of 2008 with 55,000 miles on it.  It's never given us any problems since we've owned it.  Our kids are getting older, and it's time to downsize a bit.

It's never been smoked in, and everything is in great shape inside and out.  It's been taken care of very well -- routine oil changes, new tires, new brakes, recent shocks and struts.  The V6 engine is a great combo of power and gas milage -- it won't win you any races, but you can certainly pass with ease.  We've hit 30MPG on long trips at 65MPH before with it.  While it doesn't have AWD, the weight of the car and FWD allow it to get around pretty well in the snow.

It's truly the ultimate family vehicle.  Pretty much everything in it is powered, so if your hands are full carrying groceries or a baby seat, you can just press a button to open the doors.  The dual sliding doors are an excellent convenience as well.  You can let your toddlers let themselves in and out of the vehicle by themselves and not have to worry about them door-dinging the car next to you.

The ride is very quiet and smooth.  The DVD in the rear helps keep the kids occupied, and includes 2 sets of wireless headphones.  If they get tired of wearing them, you can pipe the audio through the speakers as well.  The remote start is a godsend on those really hot and really cold days.

The video above is a total walkthrough of the vehicle, and there's a picture slideshow below as well.
