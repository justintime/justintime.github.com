  <div class="entry-content"><p>Matt Simmons over at <a href="http://www.standalone-%0Asysadmin.com/">Standalone Sysadmin</a> has been evangelizing ServerFault.com for awhile now. The idea
is great, and it really works - I&rsquo;ve learned a lot of things from the site
already. However, checking websites is so 1998 - everything I do is RSS now.
Simply adding the homepage of ServerFault.com to your RSS reader using
<a href="http://serverfault.com/feeds">http://serverfault.com/feeds</a> results in a huge amount of items that I could
care less about, and I hate clutter in my RSS reader. After poking around a
bit, I found some undocumented features that you can use to eliminate unneeded
noise from your RSS feed (or your browser if you still live in 1998 :-) ).
The key to doing this is tags. Every question on ServerFault has one or more
tags. You can view them all at
<a href="http://serverfault.com/tags">http://serverfault.com/tags</a>. There&rsquo;s two ways
you can go about getting only what you want in your feed &ndash; excluding tags or
including tags. Let&rsquo;s start with including tags.</p>

<h2>Including Tags</h2>

<p>When using this method, I haven&rsquo;t figured out how to use an &ldquo;OR&rdquo; when using
multiple tags, you can only use the builtin AND operation. Let&rsquo;s say that you
only want questions tagged with Linux. Easy enough, your feed URL would be <a href="http://serverfault.com/feeds/tag/linux">ht
tp://serverfault.com/feeds/tag/linux</a>.
Now your feed will only show you questions tagged with Linux. Say that&rsquo;s
getting to be TMI, and you want to limit that feed to only include questions
tagged Linux and Ubuntu. Simply add more tags to your feed URL with +tagname,
and urlencode the plus - resulting in this URL: <a href="http://serverfault.com/feeds/tag/linux%2Bubuntu">http://serverfault.com/feeds/
tag/linux%2bubuntu</a>. Now, you
can&rsquo;t do &ldquo;OR&rdquo;&rsquo;s in a single query, but you can create multiple feed URL&rsquo;s that
include just what you want and use your feed reader to combine them into one
folder.</p>

<h2>Excluding Tags</h2>

<p>The above example works, but not many sysadmins I know are so focused in just
a few areas. Also, the above configuration will not keep you in-tune to new
tags that you might be interested in. For myself, I&rsquo;m interested in everything
except anything Windows related. By excluding tags, you will need to go
through an iterative process, but once you&rsquo;re done you&rsquo;ll be quite happy with
the results. Let&rsquo;s get to it. The first step is to make a URL that gives an
RSS feed for all posts not tagged windows. Easy: <a href="http://serverfault.com/feeds/tag/-windows">http://serverfault.com/feeds
/tag/-windows</a>. Now, unfortunately,
many questions are tagged as windows-server-2003, but are not tagged windows.
So, we append the URL with a &ldquo;AND NOT THISTAG&rdquo; operation like this:
<a href="http://serverfault.com/feeds/tag/-windows%2B-windows-%0Aserver-2003">http://serverfault.com/feeds/tag/-windows%2B-windows-
server-2003</a>. You can see where I&rsquo;m going with this now. Using these two
methods, you can create a very nice, clean, and relevant personal RSS feed for
ServerFault&rsquo;s questions. Nothing here is rocket science, but it&rsquo;s not
documented either &ndash; hopefully it helps someone else. Note that you can
preview what your query will generate in your browser by replacing &ldquo;feeds/tag&rdquo;
in the URL with &ldquo;tags&rdquo;. In case you&rsquo;re wondering, my &ldquo;everything except
Windows&rdquo; feed URL is still not perfect, but here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve got so far:
<a href="http://serverfault.com/feeds/tag/-windows%0A%2B-windows-server-2003%2B-sqlserver%2B-windows-server-2008%2B-windows-xp%2B-%0Aiis%2B-active-directory%2B-sharepoint%2B-vista%2B-exchange%2B-outlook">http://serverfault.com/feeds/tag/-windows%2B-windows-server-2003%2B-sqlserver
%2B-windows-server-2008%2B-windows-xp%2B-iis%2B-active-directory%2B-sharepoint
%2B-vista%2B-exchange%2B-outlook</a>. Share
your URL&rsquo;s and tips I may have missed in the comments!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="/assets/images/filerun.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/large_filerun.jpg" alt="large_filerun.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>At work, we had a need for software that addresses a specific problem. We have
a bunch of users that need to share files in a secure manner via HTTPS, but
the app has to be drop-dead easy. Being an e-commerce shop, we could have
written our own, but we didn&rsquo;t have the time and resources. We could have
outsourced it to <a href="http://www.box.net">box.net</a> or a similar service, but the
company frowns upon outsourced solutions. I happened to stumble upon
<a href="http://www.filerun.com">FileRun</a>, and I have to admit that I&rsquo;ve been very
impressed. Read on for the full review.</p>

<p>First things first, let&rsquo;s get the negatives out of the way. There&rsquo;s just a
few, and they didn&rsquo;t impact us:</p>

<ul>
<li>FileRun encrypts it&rsquo;s PHP code using <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/products/guard/">Zend Guard</a>, making the majority of their code not viewable by the end user. In order to run Zend Guard encrypted binaries, you have to install a PHP module to run them.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://docs.filerun.com/index.php?title=Main_Page">online documentation</a> covers only the basics. Many of the features are undocumented, but are fairly self explanatory.</li>
<li><p>The software is written by developers in Romania. Again, this was not a problem for us, but emailing support sometimes got replies at odd hours of the day.
Now, onto the positives. First of all, FileRun is very well written software.
I&rsquo;ve found only one bug, and it was a minor bug introduced in only the most
recent update. I emailed support about it, they offered to patch it for me
immediately if I couldn&rsquo;t wait for it to be fixed in the next release. The
development team operates under the &ldquo;release early, release often&rdquo; mantra,
with new updates coming out about once a month. The support is very good; I
got fast, knowledgeable answers to all my questions. The pricing is very
workable and advertised on their site, and there is <a href="http://www.filerun.com/demo">an online demo offered at
their site</a>. Where the software shines is in it&rsquo;s
interface. The main file interface is a typical Windows-like explorer window
with two panes - one for folder navigation, the other for contents of the
selected folder. Using AJAX, they have made the application feel more like a
desktop application than a webapp. There are three methods of uploading files,
one is a standard HTML form-based upload, the second is a Flash-based upload,
and the third is a Java applet. The java applet allows for drag-and-drop
uploads, and it also gets around the PHP upload limitations allowing you to
upload unlimited file sizes (I uploaded a 2.6GB Solaris DVD iso to it and it
didn&rsquo;t skip a beat!). Any user who is used to file management on a desktop
system will be off and running in no time. The backend has the concepts of
Users, Groups, and Roles. Roles should probably have been called a &ldquo;User
Template&rdquo;, because that&rsquo;s really what they are. Each user can have one Role
assigned to it, and the Role overrides settings such as home directory,
permissions, etc. Groups are simply containers that hold one or more users,
and each user can belong to zero or greater groups. Groups are used for
sharing folders and setting permissions on shares. If I&rsquo;m in Accounting, I can
create a new directory under my home directory, and share it to the Payroll
department. When a member of the payroll department logs in, they will see my
shared folder. I can dictate whether payroll can upload, download,
rename/delete/change files and folders in that shared directory as well. While
Groups are used to set permissions on files shared between authenticated
users, one of the biggest requirements for us was to be able to offer
downloads to unauthenticated users. This is where the weblinks feature comes
in, and I believe it&rsquo;s the biggest feature in the application. Once I upload a
file to FileRun, I can generate a weblink. This is simply a link generated by
the PHP script that looks something like
<a href="http://my.domain.com/weblinks/?id=b6d767d2fde85d21a44b0e4567680cb9.">http://my.domain.com/weblinks/?id=b6d767d2fde85d21a44b0e4567680cb9.</a> The user
generating the weblink can set a shared password on the link, set an
expiration date for the link, or even set the max number of allowed downloads
for the link. The UI also has built in support for emailing a weblink directly
from the app instead of copy/paste into your MUA. FileRun supports thumbnail
generation via the <strong>convert</strong> binary from ImageMagick, so anytime a user
uploads a pdf, jpg, png, psd, etc, a thumbnail is generated. There is also a
search index feature where MS Office documents and PDF&rsquo;s are indexed and are
searchable via the UI. FileRun also supports versioning, but I haven&rsquo;t yet
researched whether or not the versioning stores only the deltas, or complete
copies of the files - I suspect the latter. Another important feature of
FileRun is that it stores the file itself on the filesystem - metadata is
stored in MySQL. This means that you can interact with the files from the OS
as well as from within FileRun. Another nice feature is the fact that it
supports zip/unzip operations from within the UI, no need for external
programs to create/extract zip files. Features that are there, but I haven&rsquo;t
played with yet include:</p></li>
<li><p>Online editing via Zoho.com and Snipshot.com</p></li>
<li>WebDav - MS Web Folders isn&rsquo;t supported (what&rsquo;s the point?)</li>
<li>Email files as attachments.</li>
<li>All actions are logged to the DB, and you can generate email-based notifications using rules. You can get emailed about every little activity, or only failures.</li>
<li>External Authentication is supported.</li>
<li>A recycle bin prevents unintended deletions.</li>
<li>See FileRun&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.filerun.com/features">full feature list</a> for more details.
We&rsquo;ve been using the software here for a couple of weeks, and I love it. It
solves a problem for us that would have cost a lot more in dev time than what
the licensing cost is, and they support the software, not us. It&rsquo;s not without
it&rsquo;s issues, the pros far outweigh the cons.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was recently asked by <a href="http://www.packtpub.com">PACKT Publishing</a> to review
the book <em><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/guide-for-learning-%0Anagios-3/book/mid/240709quylb8">Learning NAGIOS 3.0</a></em> by Wojciech Kocjan. I agreed to do so so long
as I could state whatever I felt about the book, and PACKT was fine with that.
I&rsquo;m guessing they were fine with that because they knew the book was pretty
darn good! Click through for a full chapter-by-chapter breakdown of the book.
<a href="http://www.packtpub.com%0A/guide-for-learning-nagios-3/book/mid/240709quylb8"><img src="/assets/images/Learning%20Nagios%203.0.png" alt="Learning Nagios
3.0.png" /></a> Title: <em><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/guide-for-learning-%0Anagios-3/book/mid/240709quylb8">Learning NAGIOS
3.0</a></em> Author: Wojciech Kocjan ISBN:
978-1-84719-518-0 Overall, this is a good book, with material that everyone
except the most seasoned Nagios veterans can appreciate. I myself have been
using Nagios for about the last 10 years, and I&rsquo;ve been too lazy to upgrade my
2.x install to the latest 3.x install. After reading the book, I think I&rsquo;ll
make it a priority. The book&rsquo;s main audience is probably ideally someone who
isn&rsquo;t new to *nix, but is new to Nagios. They will get the most use out of
this book. That being said, there was quite a bit of new information or tips
that I hadn&rsquo;t discovered on my own within the book as well. Perhaps what I
liked most about the book is that not only did it tell you how to get things
set up when you have only 10 hosts and 20 services to monitor, it told you how
to set things up so that performance and manageability don&rsquo;t become an issue
when that same instance of Nagios is monitoring thousands of hosts and
services. Here&rsquo;s a quick breakdown of content by chapter. Note that <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/files/learning-nagios-3-sample-chapter-7-passive-%0Achecks-and-nsca.pdf">Chapter
7</a> is clickable - you may download a PDF for free of that
chapter.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1: Nagios Overview</h2>

<p>The author does a good introduction about the core ideas and conventions in
Nagios, and at the end he offers a &ldquo;What&rsquo;s New&rdquo; section for sysadmins who are
upgrading from 2.x.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2: Installation and Configuration</h2>

<p>This chapter walks you through installing Nagios from source on Ubuntu &lsquo;Gutsy&rsquo;
7.10. It also goes through the basic tasks of creating hosts, services,
commands, time periods, contacts, and groups of objects. After getting your
feet wet, the book dives into one of the key features of Nagios, inheritance.
New to Nagios 3.0 is the capability to inherit from more than one parent,
which is a welcome addition. The final section goes into one of the most
important features (and one of the features Nagios implements best):
notifications.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3: Using the Nagios Web Interface</h2>

<p>The first precursor to using the web interface is to get it setup properly.
One key point that the book leaves out, and can be a major stumbling block for
new users is that the core of the web interface is compiled C binaries. Most
users expect PHP, Perl, or some other interpreted language, but this is not
the case in Nagios. This severely limits the number of people who can go in
and modify the web UI - everyone knows PHP, not many know C. The rest of the
chapter goes through using the web interface to check status, print reports,
etc.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4: Overview of the Nagios Plugins</h2>

<p>Each Nagios installation is only as good as it&rsquo;s plugins. In fact, without any
plugins, Nagios is unable to really do anything at all. Nagios' reliance upon
plugins is one of the reasons that it&rsquo;s been around for so long, and seems to
fit everyone&rsquo;s setup. Most use the same Nagios core, but you&rsquo;d be hard pressed
to find two installations using the exact same set of plugins. The majority of
the chapter goes over the core plugins that are included in the Nagios Plugins
distribution.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5: Advanced Configuration</h2>

<p>Chapter 5 covers some things that the Nagios docs don&rsquo;t - mainly how to
organize your definitions into a maintainable file and directory structure. It
also goes into detail about the depth-first inheritance search order, and
multiple inheritance - new to Nagios 3. Also new to Nagios 3, custom
variables, are covered here as well. Chapter 5 also covers the algorithm used
to determine flapping, and does it very well. I&rsquo;d never comprehended it until
reading the book.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6: Notifications and Events</h2>

<p>Note: This chapter has two abstracts available on PACKT&rsquo;s website - you can
read <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/article/notifications-and-events-%0Anagios-part1">Part 1 here</a>, and <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/article%0A/notifications-and-events-nagios-part2">Part 2 here</a>. This chapter goes over the ins and
outs of setting up contacts properly. The key here is to not over-notify
contacts about incidents they have no input or control on, because they will
quickly delete or even filter all messages from Nagios. The chapter also goes
into different types of notifications available to Nagios. When fixing a
broken application&rsquo;s source code is not an option, many times the only
solution is to restart the application when it fails. Nagios can do this for
you as well in what&rsquo;s referred to as Event Handlers. This chapter walks you
through setting up an event handler that restarts Apache should it die. New to
Nagios 3 is Adaptive Monitoring. Adaptive monitoring gives you the ability to
dynamically change configurations stored in the config files via the named
pipe. The remainder of the chapter walks you through building, installing, and
configuring NSCA to accept passive check results over the network.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/files/learning-nagios-3-sample-chapter-7-passive-checks-and-nsca.pdf">Chapter 7: Passive Checks and NSCA</a></h2>

<p><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/files/learning-nagios-3-sample-chapter-7%0A-passive-checks-and-nsca.pdf">Chapter 7</a> starts the content with the subject of passive
checks. Passive checks are the key to scaling Nagios to thousands of hosts.
The author then goes into the pros and cons of active and passive checks. From
there, you are taken through several examples of passive host and service
checks.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8: Monitoring Remote Hosts</h2>

<p>This chapter introduces the reader to the concept of remote checks, and how
they differ from passive checks. The first part of the chapter goes into
detail about using SSH to execute remote checks. Personally, I have never used
this approach, as it introduces a little more security risk - if someone were
to compromise the nagios user account on the Nagios server, they would likely
get shells on all your other servers as well. The next section of the chapter
goes into setting up NRPE, which I personally recommend and use extensively.
NRPE is has much less overhead than SSH, but still encrypts the connection.
Also, NRPE is not a shell, so if the nagios user is compromised on the server,
the only thing the attacker could do to the remote machines is run the
previously defined service checks on your client hosts. The author walks the
reader through examples of using both approaches.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9: SNMP</h2>

<p>SNMP is very near and dear to me - I was forced to love it when working with
DOCSIS back in my cable industry days. The author gives a pretty good
introduction to SNMP in the beginning of the chapter. After introducing the
reader to net-snmp utilities and some GUI&rsquo;s, he goes into detail about
installing and testing the net-snmp agent on the remote hosts. Once SNMP is
set up on the remote hosts, it&rsquo;s time to start playing with the check_snmp
plugin. check_snmp is not so different from other plugins, and is not bad to
setup at all. One thing that I had tried before, and failed at doing, was
setting up Nagios to be a SNMP trap destination. The author presents a way to
do this, but I would argue that his method wouldn&rsquo;t scale very well. Either
way, his method works - although it&rsquo;s important to remember that Nagios is not
a SNMP management package.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10: Advanced Monitoring</h2>

<p>The first part of the chapter goes into using NSClient++ to monitor Windows
systems. I would argue that this is not necessarily &ldquo;Advanced Monitoring&rdquo; -
maybe there should be a small chapter dedicated to monitoring Windows.
However, that&rsquo;s all semantics - the content itself is accurate and well
stated. The chapter goes into detail about installing NSClient++ and using
check_nt, check_nrpe, and passive checks using NSCA to get data from your
Windows hosts. The remainder of the chapter goes into distributed Nagios
instances. I myself have never had to do this, but in reading through the
content, it certainly looks doable. It appears as though there isn&rsquo;t too much
to the initial setup, but config file maintenance looks like it could become
cumbersome. I&rsquo;ll have to noodle on that for a bit!</p>

<h2>Chapter 11: Extending Nagios</h2>

<p>Yoda might have been quoted as saying &ldquo;Only after a padawan writes plugins
will the true power of Nagios be unveiled to him&rdquo; - or maybe not, but it&rsquo;s
definitely a true statement. That&rsquo;s what chapter 11 is all about - writing
your own plugins. I can especially appreciate the fact that the author
distinguishes between a working plugin, and a plugin written the right way.
The chapter finishes up with how you might go about writing your own web
interface (only skimming the surface for obvious reasons).</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In summary, this book is for anyone who runs, or is thinking about running
Nagios 3.0 for business or pleasure. It&rsquo;s a pretty quick read, and has quite a
bit of information in it that will have you reaching for it like you would a
reference book. In the interest of full disclosure, all links to <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/guide-for-learning-%0Anagios-3/book/mid/240709quylb8">PACKT&rsquo;s
website</a> from this article will result in me receiving
referral dollars should you purchase the book from them. I only participate in
referrals when I have personally used and approve of the product. If you
enjoyed this review and are interested in purchasing the book, I would
appreciate your referral.</p>

over to OpenSolaris</a>. Unfortunately,
I&rsquo;m going to abandon the project, and switch back to Linux as my choice as
primary desktop OS.  The main reason? Cost in productivity. It&rsquo;s not that I
can&rsquo;t build things from source, or tweak config files, but I just don&rsquo;t have
the time to anymore. <a href="http://www.sysadminsjourney.com/content/2009/06/16/fixing-%0Ametacitys-window-placement-dual-head-setups-opensolaris">Unlike
OpenSolaris</a>, dual-head works as
expected on Linux. I had to <a href="http://www.sysadminsjourney.com/content/2009/07/07/making-home-and-%0Aend-work-they-do-linux-opensolaris">do
voodoo</a> to make the home and end keys work in the
gnome-terminal. Little things, like gcc being the first compiler found in
PATH, but most binaries on the system being compiled with SunStudio cc cause
larger issues like <a href="http://www.sysadminsjourney.com/content/2009/06/19/fixing-cpan-%0Aperl-module-installation-issues-opensolaris">CPAN not working
correctly</a>. Certain things just aren&rsquo;t even
there yet, like virtual consoles, which are invaluable when troubleshooting
Xorg issues. Each one of these issues is fixable, but the key is that they
don&rsquo;t exist in the first place when I use Linux. The lack of graphics
acceleration for my card turned out to be more of an issue that I would have
thought (you want your desktop environment to be snappy). Also, not being able
to use the AHCI mode on my SATA controller killed disk I/O. Since OpenSolaris
has far fewer adopters than Linux, binary-only applications often don&rsquo;t
release binaries for OpenSolaris (<a href="http://www.getdropbox.com">Dropbox</a> for
example). The community is growing, and is very helpful, but it&rsquo;s not near
anywhere as massive as the Linux community. Often times, Google searches
result in no hits when troubleshooting. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it&rsquo;s not that I
dislike OpenSolaris, or the direction it&rsquo;s going. The opposite is true - I
love it! ZFS is truly incredible, and SMF is a godsend. IPS, while a long ways
from being as fast and comprehensive as apt-get, is a huge improvement over
the old way. In fact, one of the first things I plan on doing in Linux is
installing VirtualBox and installing OpenSolaris within it. To summarize, when
using OpenSolaris as my primary desktop OS, the &ldquo;you gotta be kidding me&rdquo;&rsquo;s
and the &ldquo;dammit&rdquo;&rsquo;s far outnumbered the &ldquo;ooh&rdquo;&rsquo;s and &ldquo;ahh&rdquo;&rsquo;s. By using Linux as
my desktop OS and OpenSolaris as a VM, I can isolate myself from the
negatives. I just can&rsquo;t afford the impact to my productivity right now. As
long as Oracle doesn&rsquo;t muck too much with the current state of affairs,
there&rsquo;s a good chance that in a year or two, I&rsquo;ll try again and have much
better luck. Until then, OpenSolaris will be on my VM&rsquo;s and Servers, but won&rsquo;t
be on my workstation.</p>

&ldquo;Recently several Visa card holders were, um, overcharged for certain
purchases, to the tune of $23,148,855,308,184,500.00 on a single charge. The
company says it was due to a programming error, and that the problem has been
corrected. What is interesting is that the amount charged actually reveals the
type of programming error that caused the problem. 23,148,855,308,184,500.00 *
100 (I&rsquo;m guessing this is how the number is actually stored) is
2314885530818450000. Convert 2314885530818450000 to hexadecimal, and you end
up with 20 20 20 20 20 20 12 50. Most C/C++ programmers see the error now &hellip;
hex 20 is a space. So spaces were stuffed into a field where binary zero
should have been.&rdquo;  That&rsquo;s probably more damage than Y2K ever hoped of doing
;-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In OpenSolaris, the xterm bindings aren&rsquo;t there for the End and Home keys -
they do nothing. Yes, I know, Ctrl+a and Ctrl+e do the same things, but my
laziness has turned into muscle memory. Here&rsquo;s how to fix it:  As your normal
user, run the following:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir /tmp/foo
env TERMINFO=/usr/share/lib/terminfo /bin/infocmp xterm &gt; /tmp/foo/xterm.ti
echo ' knp=\E[6~, kpp=\E[5~, kend=\EOF, khome=\EOH, '  &gt;&gt; /tmp/foo/xterm.ti
env TERMINFO=/tmp/foo /bin/tic -v /tmp/foo/xterm.ti
cd /usr/share/lib/terminfo/x/
pfexec cp xterm xterm.orig
pfexec cp /tmp/foo/x/xterm xterm.new
pfexec cp xterm.new xterm
</code></pre>

<p>Now your home and end keys will behave like your used to in Linux! All of this
was pretty much copied and pasted from <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/solarisx86/message/2%0A0027">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/sol

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Zones are one of the best features in Solaris 10 &ndash; they&rsquo;re so
lightweight that you can use them at almost no cost in performance.
Today, I ran across a situation where one of my zones needed more
RAM, and the box it was on didn&rsquo;t have it. Read on for how to
migrate a Solaris Zone to a different machine, and an important
update to Solaris 10/08 that makes the process <strong>so</strong> much easier.
The initial steps in migrating a zone are very similar. First, you
need to halt the zone:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="gp">#</span> zoneadm -z myzone halt</code></pre></div>


<p>Next, you need to detach it from it&rsquo;s non-global zone:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="gp">#</span> zoneadm -z my-zone detach</code></pre></div>


<p>Now, you need to copy the zone files over to machine B. You can use
rsync + ssh, tar + ssh, tar + ftp, cpio, or any other mechanism. If
you have your zone installed in /apps/zones, then the following
should do the trick:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"><span class="go">root@hostA # cd /apps/zones; tar -cf myzone.tar myzone</span>
<span class="go">root@hostA # scp myzone.tar someuser@hostB:/var/tmp/ &amp;&amp; rm myzone.tar</span>
<span class="gp">#</span> ssh over to hostB, and become root 
<span class="go">root@hostB # cd /apps/zones/ &amp;&amp; tar -xf /var/tmp/myzone.tar &amp;&amp; rm /var/tmp/myzone.tar</span>
<span class="go">root@hostB # zonecfg -z my-zone</span>
<span class="go">my-zone: No such zone configured</span>
<span class="go">Use &#39;create&#39; to begin configuring a new zone.</span>
<span class="go">zonecfg:my-zone&gt; create -a /apps/zones/my-zone</span>
<span class="go">zonecfg:my-zone&gt; commit</span>
<span class="go">zonecfg:my-zone&gt; exit</span></code></pre></div>


<p>As you can see, the process of moving a zone isn&rsquo;t too difficult,
but the sticking point is when the global zone on machine A has
different software and patches than machine B. Since a non-global
zone&rsquo;s inherit files and packages from the global zone, things can
get messy. Up until Solaris 10/08, getting things straightened out
was an exercise left up to the sysadmin, and it often times was no
small task. If you&rsquo;re on a release prior to 10/08, and there&rsquo;s a
lot of difference between Machine A &amp; B, then you have your work
cut out for you. Try this (running this on 10/08 or newer doesn&rsquo;t
hurt anything, and it allows you to &ldquo;preview&rdquo; changes):</p>

<p>WOW. That&rsquo;s a lot of cleanup. It&rsquo;s no wonder Sun was compelled to
add the update flag. Here&rsquo;s how to save yourself some hair:
At this point, you&rsquo;re good to &lsquo;boot&rsquo; the zone on HostB. Thanks to
Sun&rsquo;s update feature, moving my resource-starved zone to a larger
server was a painless ordeal</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In OpenSolaris, if you&rsquo;re installing perl modules via CPAN, you might run into
this error:</p>

<pre><code>cc: unrecognized option `-KPIC'
cc: language ildoff not recognized
cc: ReadKey.c: linker input file unused because linking not done
</code></pre>

<p>In order to fix that, edit the file /usr/perl5/5.8.4/lib/i86pc-solaris-
64int/Config.pm, and make the following changes to the existing lines for
&lsquo;optimize&rsquo; and &lsquo;cccldflags&rsquo;: <strong>UPDATE! Thanks to reader Vesta for his tip. The
original tip I posted will not fix all the issues, for example Apache2::Util
won&rsquo;t install.</strong> This problem occurs because the Sun developers build perl
with the cc from SunStudio, but by default, the first &lsquo;cc&rsquo; found in a user&rsquo;s
path is a symlink to gcc. All you need to do is to install SunStudio, and
prefer it&rsquo;s cc:</p>

<pre><code>pfexec pkg install ss-dev
</code></pre>

<p>Now, edit ~/.profile, and prepend your path with SunStudio&rsquo;s bin directory,
like so:</p>

<pre><code>export PATH=/opt/SunStudioExpress/bin/:/usr/gnu/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
</code></pre>

<p>You can log out, reboot, source the new .profile, or export a new PATH
variable to make the new settings stick. Now you should be able to install
most any Perl module!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, like I did with Linux ten years ago, I installed OpenSolaris 2009.06 on
my primary workstation at work. There&rsquo;s simply no better way to learn an OS
than to force yourself to run it. While I was pretty close to Ctrl-C'ing the
whole project a couple of times, I&rsquo;m now getting things set up pretty much the
way I need them to be. Stay tuned for articles with my tips, but here&rsquo;s my
first impressions:</p>

<ul>
<li>IPS - the new package manager is fairly robust. It certainly appears to have some speed issues, but all in all, it works pretty well. It has a good selection of software available - not extensive, but enough to get you going. I&rsquo;m sure both the speed and the quantity will both improve with time.</li>
<li>The Gnome Desktop as shipped has a very sharp and clean feel to it. It&rsquo;s hard to describe, but I like it.</li>
<li>From what I can tell, Compiz is only supported with NVidia graphics cards. The fglrx driver doesn&rsquo;t yet exist for OpenSolaris.</li>
<li>It really sucks trying to debug Xorg setup without virtual consoles!</li>
<li>While I&rsquo;m a long ways from being comfortable, I&rsquo;m now at a point that I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll find any showstopping issues.</li>
